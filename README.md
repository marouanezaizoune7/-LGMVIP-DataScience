# Data Science Internship - LetsGrowMore
This repo consists of my Internship tasks in LetsGrowMore Virtual Internship Program (LGMVIP)

> Beginner Level Task

**Task 1 - Iris Flowers Classification ML Project**

* This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning.

* The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

**Task 3 - Music Recommendation System**

* Built a Music recommender systems can suggest songs to users based on their listening patterns.

> Intermediate Level Task

**Task 6 - Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm**

* Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

* The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
